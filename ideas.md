- Japanese grammar structure (actor, target, action, etc.)
- Single word type -> Suffix for verb, suffix for identifier, suffix for category, suffix for modifier
- syllable based alphabet (which sounds? -> clearly distinct! -> no fixed pronunciation)
- word order -> importance?
- All grammatical components optional? -> context
- Qualifiers for statements (Definition, observation, hearsay, guess, ...)
- Last syllable of word is abstract stem 
- Base word stem valid -> each prefix specifies further -> each syllable a valid abstract stem?

- NOUN ADJECTIVE/MODIFIER order?

- Only written ?? No pronunciation whatsoever..
- Chinese-style: radicals -> letters -> words (禾,口 -> 和 -> 平和)

- Verb modifiers: "Finished", "Ongoing", "Not yet started" (optional?)
- "References (like 0-point)": Like より, but even more general ("The following statement is under THIS context");; Time reference: Point in time relative to which the sentence is stated -> Replaces tenses;; 
- adjectives only for things that have a "degree" to them ("temperature"-adjective, "goodness"-adjective). Always with adverb indicating degree (like Chinese).

- 8/16/N "letters" representing an initial AND final at once, depending on in which slot it appears -> N^2 total pronunciations.
- OR N^3 with initial/middle/final (with perhaps empty final [i.e. SPACE]).

- Use subset of Hanzi (radicals??) as characters (->> no custom font needed!)

- Built-in tone-indicators / other indicators. E.g. "This is an observation, no need for a reply.", "This is an invitation to share your opinion" (呢/ね/net-wa-ja), sarcasm (/s), etc.

- Descriptors of degree (強<->弱) vs. of state (藍, 紅). Only one word for the former, with degree prefix ({weak}=不強, {strong}=很強)
